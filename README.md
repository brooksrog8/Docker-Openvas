# Docker Project README

I originally started the project with the help of the openVas9 Docker installation video linked in panopto, but ran into a problem with not being able to connet to localhost.

 I thought maybe the port was being used by something else so I used XAMPP to check, but openvas was the only one using it. 

 Also tried to flush my DNS, and checked my browser settings to make sure my domain security policy allowed localhost. Nothing worked.

 So I tried another way and came upon the greenbone community documentation:
`https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/22.4/container/index.html`

This was extremely helpful and is very detailed about every step.
